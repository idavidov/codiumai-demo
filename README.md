## Summary
This code implements the maximumGap method of the Solution class, which calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given list of integers.

## Example Usage
```python
nums = [3, 6, 9, 1]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.maximumGap(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

## Code Analysis
### Main functionalities
- Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list.
- Calculate the bucket size and count based on the range of numbers.
- Initialize buckets to store the minimum and maximum values for each bucket.
- Populate the buckets by assigning each number to its corresponding bucket.
- Calculate the maximum gap by comparing the minimum value of each non-empty bucket with the maximum value of the previous non-empty bucket.
- Return the maximum gap.
